## To do:

- what to do about styling? better CSS defaults for some parts; need to use variables for colors and provide defaults for those in scss? also integrate well with bootstrap, other frameworks?
- final styling tweaks for links... no underline - grey instead? fix icons; separate by pipe? | also add genecards link... other?

- test out reactome vs kegg vs whatever in configuration
- allow multiples? like kegg AND reactome?

- chore - clean up code, improve cohesiveness, test deployment and documentation
- include in documentation instructions for making a custom section?
- show examples from various species; size of tooltips; with and without various features included
