## To do:
- Exon view (gene track) - let's add Exon 1, 2, 3, etc., in front of the location coordinate tooltips?
- 
- I would like the ideogram, if it's enabled, to render beside the chromosomal location (in line with the text)... right now, it shows up below the location coordinates?

- Fix the Pathways and Domain formatting - the pathways and domains sometimes each have duplicates - I tried to add a deduplication function but it is clearly not working; maybe it should be done on the value of the ID associated?
