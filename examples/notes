## To do:
- Modify the links:
    - Fix the ensebml link to use the ensembl gene ID instead
    - Fix the SVGs to use static PNGs - where do I store them in an NPM package?

- Modify the exon map - instead of the chevrons pointing in the direction of transcription, we will have a single label above the exon map showing the gene symbol name in bold, followed by an arrow pointing in the direction of transcription

- Modify the Pathways and Domain formatting - 1) instead of having a line-separated list, let's make it comma separated in paragraph style; this will make it more compact. The child tooltip should stay line separated though.
                                              2) the pathways and domains sometimes each have duplicates - could be reasons for this in the underlying data, but let's simply deduplicate them to get unique elements for now.
